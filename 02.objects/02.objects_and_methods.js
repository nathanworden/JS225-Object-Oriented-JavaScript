// JavaScript objects may contain methods among their properties. You can think of methods as Functions with a receiver, which is the object the method is called on. If a call doesn't have an explicit receiver, it is a function. We call these two invocation forms "method invocation" and "function invocation," respectively. We'll discuss the distinctions and nuances between these two forms in the next lesson, "Function Contexts and Objects." For now, we'll show you how to distinguish a function from a method invocation and talk about this, a keyword that is always available when a method executes.
