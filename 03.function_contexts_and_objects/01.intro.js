// JavaScript has first-class functions, which means the developer can add them to objects, execute them in the context of those objects, remove them from their objects, pass them to other functions, and run them in entirely different contexts.

// First-class Functions initially have no context; they receive one when the program executes them.

// Since JavaScript is both an object-oriented language and a language with first-class functions, it must meet the requirements of both. In particular, it must let the developer control the execution context.
